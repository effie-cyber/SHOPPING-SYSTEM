This is university  project, involving the use of OOP principles in C++. Me and my project partner made a cash and carry shopping system using Qt as  GUI. The user is asked for sign up and login, both information's are store in a text file using file handling. And when logging in, the username and password are matched, if not, error pops up. After this the user asks which department to shop from. After clicking on a department. We pick our desired object, click add to car, view cart and checkout, then fingerprint payment, where you add a standard finger code, if incorrect payment not possible
